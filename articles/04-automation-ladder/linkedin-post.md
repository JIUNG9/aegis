# LinkedIn — Article 4: 4-Stage Automation Ladder

Three variants. Pick one. Each targets 1,300 characters. No emojis. CTA to Medium + GitHub.

## Variant A — Technical

**The question is not "should the AI agent touch production." It is "how do you earn the right to let it."**

The answer is a four-stage automation ladder, enforced in code.

Stage 1 — OBSERVE. The agent watches alerts and logs findings to an audit file. No recommendations shown. This is the calibration phase.

Stage 2 — RECOMMEND. The agent surfaces recommendations in Slack and the dashboard. A human executes. The ladder measures agreement rate between the agent's recommendation and the human's actual fix.

Stage 3 — LOW-AUTO. Low-risk actions auto-execute — scale-up, cache flush, non-prod config change. Medium and high still require approval. Dry-run is mandatory. Rollback plan is mandatory.

Stage 4 — FULL-AUTO. Medium-risk auto-executes with post-validation metrics check. High-risk remains manual forever. Certain actions — IAM modifications, resource deletion — are permanently blocked.

The stage is configured per team in Settings and cannot be bypassed. Every decision lands in an SOC2-compliant audit trail.

## Variant B — Career

**I have spent enough time being the engineer called at 3 AM to know that autonomous AI in production is a bad idea on day one.**

So Aegis does not let the agent touch production on day one. Or day ten. The automation ladder is four stages, and Stage 1 is called OBSERVE for a reason — the agent watches, logs, and proves itself before it recommends anything.

This matches how I think about trust generally. You do not give a new hire prod access their first week. You do not give a new system autonomous write access in its first month. The ladder encodes that explicitly, with measurable graduation criteria between stages.

It is the opposite of the "agentic" pitch that is everywhere right now. Slower to ship. Easier to defend at 3 AM.

I work SRE at Placen (NAVER Corporation), ex-Coupang. Relocating to Canada in 2027.

## Variant C — Hot take

**Do not let AI touch production on day one.**

Half the "agentic SRE" demos I saw this quarter had the same failure mode. Alert fires. Agent reasons. Agent writes a kubectl command. Agent executes it. The demo works because the demo has exactly one service and one happy path.

Real production has four AWS accounts, forty-nine PostgreSQL instances, a hundred microservices, and blast radius that can take down your revenue stream before your on-call opens a laptop. Day-one autonomy is how you get paged twice — once for the original incident and once for the remediation.

Aegis refuses that design. Four stages: Observe, Recommend, Low-Auto, Full-Auto. The agent earns the next stage by being right. Stage 4 still never touches IAM or resource deletion. Audit trail logs every decision.

Trust is built. It cannot be configured on install.
