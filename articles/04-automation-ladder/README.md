# Article 4 — AI SRE Agent That Watches Before It Acts: The 4-Stage Automation Ladder

## What this is

Article 4 of the Aegis v4.0 Medium series. Covers Layer 4 (Guardrails) of the
Aegis architecture: observation-mode ladder (OBSERVE → RECOMMEND → LOW-AUTO →
FULL-AUTO), risk classification, dry-run pre-validation, metrics-based
post-validation, Slack approval gates, and SOC2-compliant audit logging.

The framing is the trust-building arc: "don't let an AI agent touch production
on day one." Mixes the Conf42 SRE 2026 safety-first pattern with a week-by-week
story of rolling this out on a real team at Placen (a NAVER subsidiary).
