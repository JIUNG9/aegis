# Karpathy Killed RAG — What Replaces It for SRE Teams

*Your RAG system is serving 2-year-old Confluence pages as truth. I know, because mine did.*

I'm an SRE. Our team runs a multi-account AWS estate in a hub-spoke topology, dozens of PostgreSQL instances mid-migration from PG 13 to 16, and an EKS 1.33 fleet that ArgoCD ApplicationSets deploy into from a single GitOps repo. Before this role I ran a million daily transactions on AWS ECS Fargate at a NYSE-listed commerce platform. This is my on-call rotation. My 3 AM pager. So when I say our AI agent started lying to us, I mean it lied to *me* at 3 AM, and I wrote this because I don't want it to happen to you.

This is the story of how I built a knowledge layer that doesn't rot — based on a pattern Andrej Karpathy sketched in a tweet — and the open-source implementation you can clone tonight.

## The problem: three runbook repos and a confident liar

Every SRE team I've been on has had the same problem, and if you're honest, yours does too.

You have **three runbook repos.** One in GitHub because "infra-as-code." One in Confluence because "product wanted a wiki." One in a shared Google Drive folder called `ops-docs-v2-FINAL-actual` because someone tried to unify things in 2024 and gave up halfway. Your post-mortems live in Google Docs. Your incident timelines live in Slack threads that expire after 90 days on the free tier. Your service catalog is a spreadsheet.

Then the AI wave hit and someone — maybe you, maybe your CTO — decided "let's just RAG all of it." So you wired up Pinecone. Or Chroma. Or pgvector. You ran a weekend hackathon, loaded everything, picked an embedding model (Voyage or OpenAI or Cohere, doesn't matter), and shipped a chatbot in Slack.

The first week, it felt like magic.

The second week, it told an on-call engineer to **restart the auth-service pods** when the actual current runbook says **scale the deployment to zero, wait for ALB drain, then scale back.** Because the runbook it retrieved was from 2023, before we put the service behind an ALB with connection draining. The newer version existed — but the 2023 chunk had higher cosine similarity to the query.

That's the moment I realized: **RAG isn't a knowledge system. It's a similarity search with a language model glued on top.** And similarity is not the same as truth.

## Why traditional RAG breaks for SRE

Let me be specific, because "RAG is broken" is a take that pays rent for a lot of Twitter accounts but rarely comes with receipts.

Here is what actually fails when you put vanilla RAG in front of SRE documentation:

### 1. Chunk retrieval loses context

RAG splits documents into 512- or 1024-token chunks. That's fine for a legal contract. It's catastrophic for a runbook, where step 4 only makes sense if you've done steps 1-3. The vector DB happily returns step 7 in isolation. The LLM happily answers as if step 7 is the whole procedure.

### 2. No contradiction detection

When your Confluence page says "scale to zero" and your GitHub runbook says "restart pods," traditional RAG returns both and lets the LLM pick. It will pick the one that *sounds more confident*, which usually means the older one, because the older one has been rewritten for clarity three times while the new one was pasted in yesterday by a sleepy engineer.

### 3. Staleness blind

A vector embedding has no concept of "this is 2 years old." Cosine similarity doesn't care about `last_modified`. You can bolt on metadata filters, but now you need to remember to set them on every query, every app, every agent. You won't.

### 4. Embeddings don't know what's current

Two chunks, near-identical text, one correct, one outdated. Cosine distance: 0.02. Oracle of truth: flip a coin.

> **RAG is a search engine with a language model bolted on. It's not a knowledge system. If your "knowledge" is a bag of chunks, you don't have knowledge — you have correlation.**

---

## Enter Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern

Andrej Karpathy described something offhand on Twitter late last year that I couldn't stop thinking about. The shape is simple:

> Instead of retrieving raw source chunks at query time, have the LLM **read every source once**, synthesize the content into a structured wiki page, and then let future queries hit the wiki — not the raw sources.

That's the whole thing.

Think about what changes. The synthesis step — the expensive, slow, read-every-source step — happens **once per source update**, not once per query. The query-time path just reads a flat wiki page. No vector DB. No chunking. No similarity tricks. The LLM already did the hard work of reconciling sources into a single coherent page, so queries are fast, cheap, and consistent.

It also changes the failure mode. When the wiki is wrong, you can *read the page* and see that it's wrong. It's a markdown file. A human can edit it. Git tracks every change. Compare that to debugging "why did the vector DB return this chunk" — which I have done, and it is miserable.

> **RAG retrieves slices of truth. LLM Wiki retrieves synthesized truth. The difference is that second one can be version-controlled and peer-reviewed.**

## Architecture: Aegis v4.0 Layer 1

Here is the thing I built. It's Layer 1 of a larger open-source DevSecOps platform called Aegis, but this layer stands on its own — you can run it against your own docs today.

[IMAGE: assets/01-wiki-engine-architecture.png — architecture flowchart, four sources feeding Ingester → Synthesizer → Obsidian Vault with Contradiction Detector + Staleness Linter, then Publisher → public GitHub]

The flow, if you prefer words:

1. **Ingester** normalizes every source (Confluence page, GitHub markdown, SigNoz incident payload, Slack transcript) into a common `Source` struct. No LLM involved — this is pure plumbing.
2. **Synthesizer** calls Claude Haiku twice per source. Once to *decide* whether this source creates a new page, updates an existing one, or is a duplicate to skip. Once to *write* the merge. The result is a markdown file in an Obsidian vault.
3. **Contradiction Detector** uses Claude Sonnet (reasoning-grade, worth the cost for this job) to pairwise-scan the vault for factual or procedural disagreements. It emits a JSON report you can open in Obsidian or pipe into a dashboard.
4. **Staleness Linter** flags pages whose sources haven't refreshed in N days, per source-type thresholds (Confluence decays in 90, runbooks in 120, incidents are forever).
5. **Publisher** pushes the vault to GitHub as a sanitized public repo. That repo is also a portfolio piece — recruiters can read it.

The class surface is small on purpose. Five nouns — `WikiEngine`, `Ingester`, `Synthesizer`, `ContradictionDetector`, `StalenessLinter`. If you understand those, you understand the system. The source is linked at the end of the article for anyone who wants the line-by-line.

## Why Obsidian + Claude Haiku over Pinecone + Voyage AI

I tried Pinecone first. It cost us around $90/month for a small index, integrated cleanly, and within two weeks was confidently quoting a runbook from 2023. I ripped it out.

Here is the comparison, from actually having shipped both:

- **Storage.** Traditional RAG needs a managed vector DB — proprietary, opaque, another vendor. LLM Wiki needs a folder of markdown in git. You already have that.
- **Cost.** Pinecone starts around $30-100 a month before you query anything. Aegis Wiki synthesis costs around $0.50-$2 a month on Haiku, and queries are effectively free because the wiki is just files.
- **Staleness.** RAG has none built-in. You can bolt on metadata filters, but you have to remember to set them on every query. Aegis Wiki has a `freshness` field on every page, checked by a nightly linter.
- **Contradictions.** RAG returns all matches and lets the LLM pick. Aegis Wiki detects contradictions at synthesis time and surfaces them before they reach the operator.
- **Human editability.** To edit a RAG index you rebuild it. To edit an Aegis Wiki page you open the markdown file.
- **Portability.** Vector DBs lock you in. Markdown + git runs anywhere.
- **Portfolio.** A vector blob is opaque. A public GitHub repo of synthesized runbooks is a hiring signal.
- **Review.** Vector DBs have no review workflow. Markdown gets PRs, diff, blame, comments.
- **On-call feel.** With RAG, when something's wrong, you ask "why did it say that?" With Aegis Wiki, you read the page.

And the cost table, which matters because "SRE AI tooling" is the kind of line item a CFO will cut first:

For a small team, the realistic monthly bill looks like this. **Pinecone starter + Voyage embeddings**: about $70 fixed plus per-query, so $80–120 a month. **Chroma self-hosted + OpenAI embeddings**: $40–80 a month once you count the infra it runs on. **Aegis Wiki on Claude Haiku + a local vault**: **$0.50–2 a month**, synthesis included. Two orders of magnitude cheaper than Pinecone, and it's the version that actually tells the truth at 3 AM.

Haiku is cheap enough that synthesizing every source every day is a rounding error on a personal AWS bill. Sonnet, used only for contradiction detection, runs a few cents per scan.

> **The unit economics flipped. Synthesis once, query free. The old math was query expensive, synthesis never.**

## Implementation walkthrough

The full code is in the repo; I'll show the three pieces that matter most.

### The synthesizer: two calls, not one

I deliberately split the router and the writer into separate LLM calls. The router — "should this create, update, or skip?" — needs an *index* of all pages: slug, title, type, and a one-line summary of each. It does not need the full bodies, which would blow the context window on a large vault. The writer — "produce the merged page" — needs the *body* of exactly one target page and the new source, nothing else.

Two calls, two focused contexts, roughly half the token bill of a naive single call. On a vault of two hundred pages, the router is dirt cheap (it sees a few kilobytes of index) and the writer is bounded (it sees one page plus one source). Neither is ever looking at the whole vault.

### The page schema: structured, not soup

Every wiki page is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter. That frontmatter is the contract between the engine and the vault:

```yaml
---
title: auth-service
type: entity
slug: auth-service
last_updated: 2026-04-19T10:00:00Z
sources:
  - confluence:12345
  - signoz:INC-EXAMPLE-001
  - github:acme-corp/auth-service
freshness: current
tags: [service, spring-boot, oauth2]
aliases: [auth, auth-svc]
---

# auth-service

...
```

Four page types — `entity`, `concept`, `incident`, `runbook` — and four freshness states — `current`, `stale`, `archived`, `needs_review`. That's the entire type system. It fits in a tweet. It also turns out to be sufficient for every page I've needed to write.

### The engine: lazy, degradable, honest

Layer 1 is built to degrade gracefully. The contradiction detector and the staleness linter are optional; if either fails to import or runs into an error, the engine reports the feature as unavailable and keeps serving reads from the vault. This mattered during development, when several modules were landing in parallel — but it matters more in production, where a single broken subsystem should never take the whole knowledge layer down at 3 AM. You keep the wiki searchable even when half the machinery is offline.

---

## The staleness and contradiction engines — why these matter

This is the part I'm proudest of, because it's the part that solves the real failure mode.

### Staleness as a first-class concept

Each source type decays at a different rate. The defaults that ship with the engine:

- **Confluence** — stale at 90 days, archived at 180, checked daily
- **GitHub docs** — stale at 60 days, archived at 180, checked daily
- **Runbooks** — stale at 120 days, archived at 365, checked weekly
- **Incidents** — stale at 365 days, archived at 730, checked weekly

Confluence rots fastest because product teams abandon docs. Runbooks decay slower because procedures are mostly stable. Incidents are archived but almost never deleted, because post-mortems are the most valuable learning asset a team has.

The linter runs daily as a cron, marks every stale page with `freshness: stale`, and emits a JSON report. That report is how Obsidian knows to render stale pages in amber and archived ones in grey.

### Contradiction detection as an auditor

The scenario that made me build this: runbook A says "restart the pods." Confluence page B says "scale to zero, wait for drain, scale back." Both were written by competent engineers. Both are wrong for the other one's context.

The contradiction detector pairs pages on the same topic and asks Claude Sonnet to identify *only* conflicts where a reader following one would take a different action than a reader following the other. The schema is tight:

```json
{
  "claim_a": "Restart the auth-service pods via kubectl rollout restart",
  "claim_b": "Scale the deployment to 0, wait for ALB drain, then scale to N",
  "severity": "critical",
  "category": "procedure_conflict",
  "explanation": "A pod restart doesn't drain the ALB target group; callers see 502s for ~30s"
}
```

Four categories (`version_mismatch`, `procedure_conflict`, `coverage_gap`, `factual_contradiction`), three severities (`critical`, `warning`, `info`). Critical means following the wrong doc causes an incident. Warning means wasted time. Info means stylistic drift.

The detector persists to `_meta/contradictions.json`. Obsidian renders it as a dashboard. You, the SRE, click through and resolve them. The vault is now an auditable trail of "we used to disagree on X, here's what we decided."

---

## Results

Three months into running this against real production SRE docs:

- **Cost:** ~$1.20/month average. Peak day (full Confluence re-sync) was $4.70. For a vault of ~200 pages and daily ingests.
- **Accuracy on "which runbook is current":** our internal agent went from correct-about-60%-of-the-time (Pinecone era) to correct-about-95%-of-the-time (Wiki era). The 5% is usually a page the team hasn't resolved a contradiction on yet — which is *visible* and actionable, not silent.
- **Onboarding:** new engineer was productive in week one. The vault answers "how does service X work" in one page, not eight.
- **Portfolio value:** the sanitized public vault at [github.com/JIUNG9/aegis-wiki](https://github.com/JIUNG9/aegis-wiki) became a live demonstration of SRE practice across AWS hub-spoke, EKS 1.33, Terraform, ArgoCD, SigNoz, and Aurora PostgreSQL. Recruiters read it. One of them told me it was the most concrete portfolio they'd seen that year.

The vault looks like this in Obsidian:

- `entities/` — services, accounts, clusters. The nouns of the infrastructure.
- `concepts/` — SRE practices: error budgets, hub-spoke AWS, blue-green deploys.
- `incidents/` — every post-mortem, linked to affected entities.
- `runbooks/` — operational procedures with real kubectl and aws CLI commands.
- `_meta/` — engine state, sync timestamps, contradiction reports.
- `overview.md` — auto-regenerated service index, recent incidents, known patterns.

Graph view shows every page linked to every page that references it via `[[WikiLinks]]`. That graph *is* the service topology. It's also the closest thing to a living architecture diagram we've ever had.

> **I stopped writing architecture docs. The graph is the architecture doc. It is always current because the engine keeps it current.**

## What's next

This is Layer 1 of six. The next pieces of this series:

- **Article #2 — "Your Docs Are Lying to You: Stale Docs Detection with MCP Reconciliation"** — a deeper dive on the contradiction engine, the MCP server that exposes it to Claude Desktop, and how I used it to find 14 disagreements across my own runbooks in the first week.
- **Layer 2: SigNoz Connector** — auto-ingest incidents and alerts into the wiki. Covers the event contract, the replay semantics, and why I stopped trusting Prometheus for post-incident context.
- **Layer 0: Safety Foundation** — the part I wrote last, after realising I was one HTTPS call away from sending real production log lines to a server in a different jurisdiction. PII proxy, local-LLM router, kill switch, honey tokens. How to run an AI agent over production data without becoming the incident.

If you run this and it helps, tell me. If it doesn't, tell me louder — I will fix it, because this is my on-call, too.
