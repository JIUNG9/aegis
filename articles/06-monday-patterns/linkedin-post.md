# LinkedIn — Article 6: 80% Monday 9 AM

Three variants. Pick one. Each targets 1,300 characters. No emojis. CTA to Medium + GitHub.

## Variant A — Technical

**Eighty percent of our auth-service incidents cluster between Monday 09:00 and 11:00 KST. I did not know this until the pattern analyzer told me.**

The SigNoz connector in Aegis aggregates resolved-incident timestamps by hour of week. On my own data the pattern was obvious once plotted: Monday morning traffic spike, overnight batch jobs still holding database connections, connection pool exhaustion at the exact moment load returns.

The analyzer surfaces three pattern classes:

- Time-of-week — recurring hour-of-week clusters
- Trend — moving average plus standard deviation, flagging anomalies
- Correlation — incidents versus deployments versus config changes, regression over time

Each pattern becomes a wiki page. The Control Tower reads those pages during subsequent investigations. When a new Monday 09:30 alert fires on auth-service, the agent starts from "here is the recurring pattern, here is the likely cause, here is the runbook."

Cost: zero. SigNoz is OSS. The analyzer is 300 lines of Python.

## Variant B — Career

**The pattern was in the data for months. I only saw it when I asked the right question.**

Eighty percent of our auth-service incidents happen on Monday mornings. Same two-hour window every week. I had been on-call through several of them without spotting it, because my mental aggregation stops at "Mondays feel worse."

The fix was boring: a Python module that aggregates resolved incidents by hour of week, by service, by correlation with deployments. Four hundred lines. SigNoz connector underneath.

The lesson is not "build an analyzer." The lesson is that SRE work is full of latent patterns your intuition will miss because you only see each individual incident, never the population.

I run SRE at Placen (NAVER Corporation). Aegis is my side project that turns day-job lessons into open source. Relocating to Canada in 2027.

## Variant C — Hot take

**Eighty percent of your incidents happen on the same two hours of the same day every week. You have never looked.**

I ran the numbers on my own team. Auth-service errors, aggregated by hour of week. Monday 09:00 to 11:00 was a mountain. The rest of the week was noise. One bucket, twenty percent of the week, eighty percent of the pages.

This is not specific to my team. Every SRE team has a version of this pattern. Weekly deploy cycles, batch jobs, Monday morning traffic spikes, the coffee-run-inflicted config push. You just have not asked the data the right question.

Aegis Layer 2 is a pattern analyzer that does the asking for you. Hour-of-week clusters. Deploy correlations. Anomaly flags. The patterns go into the wiki. The agent reads them during the next investigation.

Run the aggregation on your own SigNoz data. Pick one service. You will find it.
